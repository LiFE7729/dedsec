# dedsec
'You've Been Hacked' screen including ASCII Art and animations

*"dedsec" is a fictional hacker group. I do not own the group name or anything related to it, I've just borrowed the name because it worked with the style that I was aiming for in this project*

This project was created and intended to scare individuals in a work environment. Attached in this is a training link for users in my specific work environment to utilize after failing the phish test.
